          "The Republican-led House of Representatives passed the \"No Rogue Rulings Act\" in a 219-213 vote, which would limit federal district judges' ability to issue nationwide injunctions blocking presidential policies. The legislation, championed by Rep. Darrell Issa, would restrict judges' decisions to apply only to original plaintiffs rather than nationwide, amid growing tensions between the Trump administration and judiciary over various executive orders being challenged in court.",

          "House Speaker Mike Johnson postponed a critical budget vote originally scheduled for Wednesday after failing to secure enough support from Republican holdouts. The budget resolution, which would advance President Trump's agenda of tax cuts and spending reductions, faced opposition from conservative members who demanded deeper spending cuts before approving trillions in tax breaks. Johnson vowed to try again on Thursday after working through the night to negotiate a compromise.",
